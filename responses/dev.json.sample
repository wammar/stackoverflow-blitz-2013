It should exhibit O(n) or O(logn) runtimes.</p>\n\n<p>My own algorithms tend to either be lousy (fast but produce huge patches) or slow (produce small patches but have O(n^2) runtime).</p>\n\n<p>Any advice, or pointers for implementation would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the implementation will be used to keep servers in sync for various large datafiles that we have one master server for. When the master server datafiles change, we need to update several off-site servers as well.</p>\n\n<p>The most naive algorithm I have made, which only works for files that can be kept in memory, is as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Grab the first four bytes from the <em>old</em> file, call this the <em>key</em></li>\n<li>Add those bytes to a dictionary, where <em>key -> position</em>, where <em>position</em> is the position where I grabbed those 4 bytes, 0 to begin with</li>\n<li>Skip the first of these four bytes, grab another 4 (3 overlap, 1 one), and add to the dictionary the same way</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all 4-byte blocks in the <em>old</em> file</li>\n<li>From the start of the <em>new</em> file, grab 4 bytes, and attempt to look it up in the dictionary</li>\n<li>If found, find the longest match if there are several, by comparing bytes from the two files</li>\n<li>Encode a reference to that location in the <em>old</em> file, and skip the matched block in the <em>new</em> file</li>\n<li>If not found, encode 1 byte from the <em>new</em> file, and skip it</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 5-8 for the rest of the <em>new</em> file</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is somewhat like compression, without windowing, so it will use a lot of memory. It is, however, fairly fast, and produces quite small patches, as long as I try to make the codes output minimal.</p>\n\n<p>A more memory-efficient algorithm uses windowing, but produces much bigger patch files.</p>\n\n<p>There are more nuances to the above algorithm that I skipped in this post, but I can post more details if necessary. I do, however, feel that I need a different algorithm altogether, so improving on the above algorithm is probably not going to get me far enough.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #1</strong>: Here is a more detailed description of the above algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>First, combine the two files, so that you have one big file. Remember the cut-point between the two files.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, do that <em>grab 4 bytes and add their position to the dictionary</em> step for everything in the whole file.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, from where the <em>new</em> file starts, do the loop with attempting to locate an existing combination of 4 bytes, and find the longest match. Make sure we only consider positions from the old file, or from <em>earlier in the new file than we're currently at</em>. This ensures that we can reuse material in both the old and the new file during patch application.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit #2</strong>: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/lvknet/source/browse/trunk/LVK/IO/Patching/Binary/BinaryPatch.cs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source code to the above algorithm</a></p>\n\n<p>You might get a warning about the certificate having some problems.

The first step is to reproduce the problem -- but we can't. </p>\n\n<p>Here's some background:</p>\n\n<p>Prod has a single virtualized (vmware) web server with two CPUs and 2 GB of RAM.  The database server has 4GB, and 2 CPUs as well.  It's also on VMWare, but separate physical hardware.</p>\n\n<p>During normal usage the application runs fine.  The w3wp.exe process normally uses betwen 5-20% CPU and around 200MB of RAM.  CPU and RAM fluctuate slightly under normal use, but nothing unusual.</p>\n\n<p>However, when we start running into problems, the RAM climbs dramatically and the CPU pegs at 98% (or as much as it can get).  The site becomes unresponsive, necessitating a IIS restart.  Resetting the app pool does nothing in this situation, a full IIS restart is required.</p>\n\n<p>It does not happen during the night (no usage).  It happens more when the site is under load, but it has also happened under non-peak periods.</p>\n\n<p>First step to solving this problem is reproducing it. To simulate the load, we starting using JMeter to simulate usage. Our load script is based on actual usage around the time of the crash.  Using JMeter, we can ramp the usage up quite high (2-3 times the load during the crash) but the site behaves fine.  CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any tips on how to reproduce a problem like this in a non-production environment?
