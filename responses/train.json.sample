You will have no easy way to port your logic over in a way that will ultimately save you time and not keep you shackled to the deficiencies of Visual Basic 6.0. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of ROI: make a list of all of the support tasks that you have made in the past year, and estimate how much of a time savings they would have been if you were working with a well-structured VB.NET application vs. your old Visual Basic 6.0 dinosaur. This is your yearly support savings. Then if you have any big upgrades coming up, figure these in as well. Are there any proposed new features or upgrades that have been rejected because they were too hard in Visual Basic 6.0, but that would be doable in VB.NET? If there are big features coming up or that you would like to include, then you could see a good ROI for going to VB.NET. If the program is basically stagnant and there are no plans to change the status quo, then you probably wont get the buy in that you need.</p>\n", "ViewCount": "", "LastActivityDate": "2011-04-08T11:22:25.750", "LastEditorUserId": "63550", "LastEditorDisplayName": "", "LastEditDate": "2011-04-08T11:22:25.750", "CommentCount": "5", "Question": {"Body": "<p>My company makes a monolithic piece of software that our customers use to run their car dealerships. The original application was written in Visual Basic 6.0, and it has grown substantially over the last few years. Until now, there hasn't really been a business case for switching to the .NET framework. Sure, it's newer, considerably better at certain things, and when used correctly speeds development time, but there's nothing we can't do in Visual Basic 6.0 that we need to be able to do. Getting things done is harder in Visual Basic 6.0, but almost nothing is impossible.

{"Body": "<p>@Bernard:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have to admit, most of your example went straight over my head. It does compile, and seems to work, though. Is this safe for SMP systems or SpeedStep?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's a good question... I think the code's ok.\nFrom a practical standpoint, we use it in my company every day,\nand we run on a pretty wide array of boxes, everything from 2-8 cores.\nOf course, YMMV, etc, but it seems to be a reliable and low-overhead\n(because it doesn't make a context switch into system-space) method\nof timing.</p>\n\n<p>Generally how it works is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>declare the block of code to be assembler (and volatile, so the\noptimizer will leave it alone).</li>\n<li>execute the CPUID instruction.  In addition to getting some CPU information\n(which we don't do anything with) it synchronizes the CPU's execution buffer\nso that the timings aren't affected by out-of-order execution.</li>\n<li>execute the rdtsc (read timestamp) execution.  This fetches the number of\nmachine cycles executed since the processor was reset.  This is a 64-bit\nvalue, so with current CPU speeds it will wrap around every 194 years or so.\nInterestingly, in the original Pentium reference, they note it wraps around every\n5800 years or so.</li>\n<li>the last couple of lines store the values from the registers into\nthe variables hi and lo, and put that into the 64-bit return value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specific notes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>out-of-order execution can cause incorrect results, so we execute the\n\"cpuid\" instruction which in addition to giving you some information\nabout the cpu also synchronizes any out-of-order instruction execution.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most OS's synchronize the counters on the CPUs when they start, so\nthe answer is good to within a couple of nano-seconds.</p></li>\n<li><p>The hibernating comment is probably true, but in practice you\nprobably don't care about timings across hibernation boundaries.</p></li>\n<li><p>regarding speedstep: Newer Intel CPUs compensate for the speed\nchanges and returns an adjusted count.  I did a quick scan over\nsome of the boxes on our network and found only one box that\ndidn't have it: a Pentium 3 running some old database server.\n(these are linux boxes, so I checked with: grep constant_tsc /proc/cpuinfo)</p></li>\n<li><p>I'm not sure about the AMD CPUs, we're primarily an Intel shop,\nalthough I know some of our low-level systems gurus did an\nAMD evaluation.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope this satisfies your curiosity, it's an interesting and (IMHO)\nunder-studied area of programming.  You know when Jeff and Joel were\ntalking about whether or not a programmer should know C?

{"Body": "<p>Unit testing is, roughly speaking, testing bits of your code in isolation with test code. The immediate advantages that come to mind are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Running the tests becomes automate-able and repeatable</li>\r\n<li>You can test at a much more granular level than point-and-click testing via a GUI</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that if your test code writes to a file, opens a database connection or does something over the network, it's more appropriately categorized as an integration test. Integration tests are a good thing, but should not be confused with unit tests. Unit test code should be short, sweet and quick to execute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to look at unit testing is that you write the tests first. This is known as Test-Driven Development (TDD for short). TDD brings additional advantages:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You don't write speculative \"I might need this in the future\" code -- just enough to make the tests pass</li>\r\n<li>The code you've written is always covered by tests</li>\r\n<li>By writing the test first, you're forced into thinking about how you want to call the code, which usually improves the design of the code in the long run.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're not doing unit testing now, I recommend you get started on it. Get a good book, practically any xUnit-book will do because the concepts are very much transferable between them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes writing unit tests can be painful. When it gets that way, try to find someone to help you, and resist the temptation to \"just write the damn code\". Unit testing is a lot like washing the dishes. It's not always pleasant, but it keeps your metaphorical kitchen clean, and you really want it to be clean. :)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Edit: One misconception comes to mind, although I'm not sure if it's so common.

{"Body": "<p>I don't disagree with Dan (although a better choice may just be not to answer)...but...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unit testing is the process of writing code to test the behavior and functionality of your system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously tests improve the quality of your code, but that's just a superficial benefit of unit testing. The real benefit are to</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Make it easier to change the technical implementation while making sure you don't change the behavior (refactoring). Properly unit tested code can be aggressively refactored/cleaned up with little chance of breaking anything.</li>\r\n<li>Give developers confidence when adding behavior or making fixes.</li>\r\n<li>Document your code</li>\r\n<li>Indicate areas of your code that are tightly coupled. It's hard to unit test code that's tightly coupled</li>\r\n<li>Provide a means to use your API and look for difficulties early on</li>\r\n<li>Indicates methods and classes that aren't very cohesive</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>You should unit test because its in your interest to deliver a maintainable and quality product to your client.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd suggest you use it for any system, or part of a system, which models real-world behavior. In other words, it's particularly well suited for enterprise development. I would not use it for throw-away/utility programs. I would not use it for parts of a system that are problematic to test (UI is a common example, but that isn't always the case)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greatest pitfall is that developers test too large a unit, or they consider a method a unit. This is particularly true if you don't understand Inversion of Control - in which case your unit tests will always turn into end-to-end integration testing. Unit test should test individual behaviors - and most methods have many behaviors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greatest misconception is that programmers shouldn't test. Only bad or lazy programmers believe that. Should the guy building your roof not test it? Should the doctor replacement a heart valve not test the new valve? Only a programmer can test that his code does what he intended it to do (QA can test edge cases - how code behaves when its told to do things the programmer didn't intend, and the client can do acceptance test - does the code do what what the client paid for it to do)</p>", "ViewCount": "", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-04T16:41:17.560", "Question": {"Body": "<p>I saw many questions asking 'how' to unit test in a specific language, but no question asking 'what', 'why', and 'when'.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is it?</li>\n<li>What does it do for me?</li>\n<li>Why should I use it?</li>\n<li>When should I use it (also when not)?</li>\n<li>What are some common pitfalls and misconceptions</li>\n</ul>\n", "AnswerCount": "18", "LastActivityDate": "2011-10-22T19:30:20.270", "Tags": "<unit-testing><glossary>", "LastEditorUserId": "63550", "LastEditorDisplayName": "Steve M", "LastEditDate": "2011-10-22T11:22:01.230", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "314", "AcceptedAnswerId": "1393", "Score": "96", "ViewCount": "7563", "User": {"DisplayName": "Uberfuzzy", "AboutMe": "OH, thats what this gray box is for...", "Views": "103", "DownVotes": "0", "LastAccessDate": "2012-07-31T19:38:16.513", "WebsiteUrl": "http://uberfuzzy.com", "EmailHash": "7072811ac786cb9aff2aecb8a5e55077", "Reputation": "1402", "Location": "Cleveland, OH", "Age": "30", "UpVotes": "124", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T15:25:23.360", "Id": "314"}, "PostTypeId": "1", "Title": "What is unit testing?", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T16:27:39.787", "FavoriteCount": "45", "Id": "1383"}, "Score": "32", "User": {"DisplayName": "Karl Seguin", "AboutMe": "Check out my <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5jaae2\" rel=\"nofollow\">free ebook</a>", "Views": "408", "DownVotes": "9", "LastAccessDate": "2012-02-04T00:55:28.387", "WebsiteUrl": "http://www.openmymind.net/", "EmailHash": "6f448664cd294829b9ed0cd356f91cb1", "Reputation": "7553", "Location": "Ottawa, Canada", "Age": "32", "UpVotes": "51", "CreationDate": "2008-08-01T12:39:52.493", "Id": "34"}, "PostTypeId": "2", "OwnerUserId": "34", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T16:41:17.560", "Id": "1398", "ParentId": "1383"}

{"Body": "<p>This is my take on it. I would say unit testing is the practice of writing software tests to verify that your real software does what it is meant to. This started with <a href=\"http://junit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jUnit</a> in the Java world and has become a best practice in PHP as well with <a href=\"http://simpletest.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SimpleTest</a> and <a href=\"http://www.phpunit.de/\" rel=\"nofollow\">phpUnit</a>. It's a core practice of Extreme Programming and helps you to be sure that your software still works as intended after editing. If you have sufficient test coverage, you can do major refactoring, bug fixing or add features rapidly with much less fear of introducing other problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's most effective when all unit tests can be run automatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unit testing is generally associated with OO development. The basic idea is to create a script which sets up the environment for your code and then exercises it; you write assertions, specify the intended output that you should receive and then execute your test script using a framework such as those mentioned above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The framework will run all the tests against your code and then report back success or failure of each test. phpUnit is run from the Linux command line by default, though there are HTTP interfaces available for it. SimpleTest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running, IMO. In combination with xDebug, phpUnit can give you automated statistics for code coverage which some people find very useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some teams write hooks from their subversion repository so that unit tests are run automatically whenever you commit changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's good practice to keep your unit tests in the same repository as your application.</p>", "ViewCount": "", "LastActivityDate": "2008-08-04T23:53:16.440", "Question": {"Body": "<p>I saw many questions asking 'how' to unit test in a specific language, but no question asking 'what', 'why', and 'when'.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What is it?</li>\n<li>What does it do for me?</li>\n<li>Why should I use it?</li>\n<li>When should I use it (also when not)?</li>\n<li>What are some common pitfalls and misconceptions</li>\n</ul>\n", "AnswerCount": "18", "LastActivityDate": "2011-10-22T19:30:20.270", "Tags": "<unit-testing><glossary>", "LastEditorUserId": "63550", "LastEditorDisplayName": "Steve M", "LastEditDate": "2011-10-22T11:22:01.230", "CommentCount": "2", "OwnerUserId": "314", "AcceptedAnswerId": "1393", "Score": "96", "ViewCount": "7563", "User": {"DisplayName": "Uberfuzzy", "AboutMe": "OH, thats what this gray box is for...", "Views": "103", "DownVotes": "0", "LastAccessDate": "2012-07-31T19:38:16.513", "WebsiteUrl": "http://uberfuzzy.com", "EmailHash": "7072811ac786cb9aff2aecb8a5e55077", "Reputation": "1402", "Location": "Cleveland, OH", "Age": "30", "UpVotes": "124", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T15:25:23.360", "Id": "314"}, "PostTypeId": "1", "Title": "What is unit testing?", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T16:27:39.787", "FavoriteCount": "45", "Id": "1383"}, "Score": "2", "User": {"DownVotes": "42", "DisplayName": "Flubba", "Views": "255", "Age": "45", "LastAccessDate": "2012-07-30T15:41:59.170", "EmailHash": "28272f433e6bf32d3750fe46933cedc7", "Reputation": "7456", "Location": "England, United Kingdom", "UpVotes": "251", "CreationDate": "2008-08-02T10:46:12.550", "Id": "137"}, "PostTypeId": "2", "OwnerUserId": "137", "CreationDate": "2008-08-04T23:53:16.440", "Id": "1718", "ParentId": "1383"}

{"Body": "<p>Never trust user input, never trust client input at all, client side sanitation efforts are worthless, it doesn't take much sophistication to access your web app directly. <strong>Always perform sanitation server-side</strong>, don't even bother with client-side sanitation, it's a waste of effort. There are a couple techniques that are useful for avoiding SQL injection attacks, I'll go from least favored to most favored.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>3: Custom-Written Value Sanitation.</strong> Avoid writing your own sanitation routines as much as possible except when it's absolutely the only option remaining (which is very unlikely in any modern language). Input sanitation is a hard problem, and the costs of getting it wrong are huge. It's best to leave that job to someone else. When you are forced to rely on this method use white-listing rather than black-listing to sanitize input.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>2: Framework / Library Based Value Sanitation.</strong> Leave the sanitation routines to the domain experts. Sanitation routines in 1st party frameworks and libraries are typically created by the same folks that wrote the DB or the SQL API. They have a much higher chance of knowing, and properly handling, all of the edge cases than you do. An example of this technique would be using php's mysql_escape_string() function to sanitize values that will be inserted into strings that serve as dynamic SQL statements.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>1: Parameter Binding.</strong> (aka prepared statements) Instead of constructing a SQL statement as a raw string which includes user data as in-place literal values, create a SQL statement with tokens where the user data would be. Then bind the user supplied data to the appropriate parameters. The key here is that this binds the provided data to a specific type and a specific use and eliminates any opportunity to change the logic of the SQL statement.
